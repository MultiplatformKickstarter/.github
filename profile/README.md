## Welcome to Multiplatform Kickstarter Github Organization 👋

Create multiplatform applications within minutes using **Kotlin Multiplatform** + **Compose Multiplatform**.

Developed by industry veterans, Multiplatform Kickstarter is going to be the first Open Source template that will help you to kickstart your business.

Most templates only solves the basic functionality, we are aiming to solve most of the common problems when creating applications from initial status to production.

With few simple steps you will have up and running applications for *Android*, *iOS*, *Desktop* and *Web* using *Ktor* as the server.

It will be available on **late 2023**.
